# clean_subtitles zsh plugin

This is a custom ZSH plugin Matt wrote to support the subtitle pattern-matching
script he wrote for his content creation work.

The plugin checks for the existence of the script, clean_subtitles, and then
tells the script to generate completion for the various projects, if completion
does not already exist.

This README exists only so that the `omz plugin info` command works.
