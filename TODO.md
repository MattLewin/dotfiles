# TODO

- replace `direnv`, `virtualenv`, `nvm`, etc. with `asdf`?
- implement a git post-merge hook to determine whether the umbrella `Brewfile` or this host or architecture's specific ones have changed, and if so, performa a `brew file install`
- replace [spaceship prompt](https://spaceship-prompt.sh) with [starship](https://starship.rs)?
- clone all submodules upon initial install instead of relying upon the cloner to do it
- replace `brew file` with Homebrew's `brew bundle`
